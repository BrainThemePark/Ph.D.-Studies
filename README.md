# **Human Path of Action**

## **Overview**
This repository contains data, analysis scripts, and documentation for my research project focused on human behavior. This work is part of my preparation for a Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences, where I am exploring the lack of action once acquired the "How to".

## **Goals**
The goal of this project is to analyze actions to gain insights into brain chemicals. This research will contribute to my ongoing academic work in Biomedical Sciences.

## **Data**
The data used in this project includes genomic sequences, medical imaging, etc., which will be obtained from people in the Caribbean. The data is stored in the `data/` directory, organized into raw and processed formats.

## **Methods**
Data analysis is conducted using [software/tools, e.g., Python, R, Jupyter Notebooks], with a focus on [specific methods, e.g., statistical analysis, machine learning, etc.]. The analysis scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory.

## **Results**
The initial analysis has revealed [brief summary of findings]. Further work will focus on [next steps in research].

## **Usage**
To replicate the analysis, clone this repository and run the scripts in the `scripts/` directory. Detailed instructions are provided in each script's header.

## **Contributing**
Contributions are welcome! Please submit pull requests or open issues to discuss potential improvements or new features.
